# kindle-sideload
Unfortunately, Kindle reading devices do not support FB2, and most EPUB files from bookstores are converted by Amazon services with significant losses

I created this service to solve both problems at once: 
now you can quickly get quality converted books on Kindle, with preserved page layout, margins, indents, and fonts

I tried to make the service's use not too different from using the official Kindle app from Google Play or App Store, and I hope I succeeded

The service will remain free and available to all users without restrictions as long as possible

The project uses the <a href="https://github.com/rupor-github/fb2converter">fb2converter</a> under the GPL-3.0, and I would like to thank the author for his work
Please use the service for good and do not deprive authors of the opportunity to earn from their books
